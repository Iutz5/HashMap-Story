HashMap Story-Telling Lab

I did not work with a buddy during this lab

This lab took me about an hour to finish

I liked this assignment! It was a good way to add creativity to the project while
still allowing there to be a useful purpose for making the hashmaps. As I was
progressing through the assignment, making and finding the hashmaps and the
components that are associated within the hashmaps were easier and easier to find
and build

No problems from me!
